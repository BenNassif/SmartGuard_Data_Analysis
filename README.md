# SmartGuard_Data_Analysis
## About This Study
This is a analysis of the effectiveness of SmartGuard, a patch that attaches to sows created by SwineTech that is intended to reduce the number of piglets that get laid on by sows. This product works by analyzing the sound wave frequencies of piglet squeals and alerts the mother sow to stand up with a chiropractic impulse. The data I am using was obtained from a trial at a confidential barn. There are two groups of sows in this trial, the first group is a control group (sows that aren't wearing a SmartGuard patch) and the SmartGuard group.  

### Dataset  
I used the dataset FarmA_data.xlsx for this analysis. If you wish to replicate this code, you will need to chance the file path to this data in the code.
